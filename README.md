# Calculator-Extention-Alpha
Working on a Chrome Extention that is a full GUI calculator with working memory storage. So far it can't do multiple operations since this is initial commit.
<br>
To test out the extention, download repository and then put all the files in a folder. Enable developer mode in Google Chrome then drag that folder into the extension page of Google Chrome. Make sure manifest.json is in that folder or Google Chrome won't read the directory as an extention directory.
